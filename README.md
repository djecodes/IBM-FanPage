# IBM-FanPage
A hands-on website project making a quick wiki page for Thomas J. Watson, CEO and Chairman of IBM in 1914-1956

What I learned in this project was:
- Reviewing the process of initializing an html page
- HTML Tables and how they are formatted
- Hands on experiences creating a wiki page from scratch
